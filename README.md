## Notes for reviewers (thanks Micah Dubinko):

### Conda approach

(Highly recommended) Here's how to start fresh:

Install Python 3.8+ Anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual then

```bash
% conda update conda
% conda init zsh  # adjust to taste
% conda env create --file environment.yml
% conda activate cleaning
% R -f setup.R
```

## Other tools

### PostgreSQL

### Node

### Spark


### Mac homebrew

Micah: I had to follow these instructions to get Python 3.8 working:

(maybe I should bite the bullet and to with conda...)
