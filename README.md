## About the Book
It is something of a truism in data science, data analysis, or machine learning that most of the effort needed to achieve your actual purpose lies in cleaning your data. Written in Davidâ€™s signature friendly and humorous style, this book discusses in detail the essential steps performed in every production data science or data analysis pipeline and prepares you for data visualization and modeling results.

The book dives into the practical application of tools and techniques needed for data ingestion, anomaly detection, value imputation, and feature engineering. It also offers long-form exercises at the end of each chapter to practice the skills acquired.

You will begin by looking at data ingestion of data formats such as JSON, CSV, SQL RDBMSes, HDF5, NoSQL databases, files in image formats, and binary serialized data structures. Further, the book provides numerous example data sets and data files, which are available for download and independent exploration.

Moving on from formats, you will impute missing values, detect unreliable data and statistical anomalies, and generate synthetic features that are necessary for successful data analysis and visualization goals.

By the end of this book, you will have acquired a firm understanding of the data cleaning process necessary to perform real-world data science and machine learning tasks.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code for each chapter is within Jupyter Notebooks.

The code will look like the following:
```python
scaler = sklearn.preprocessing.RobustScaler()
scaler.fit(X)
X_scaled = scaler.transform(X_train)
```
